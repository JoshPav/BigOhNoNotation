# Three Million Men Javascript

A template project to implement your solution to the 3 million men problem.

## The Problem

- Three million men with distinct names were laid end-to-end, reaching from New York to California.

- Each participant was given a slip of paper on which he wrote down his own name and the name of the person immediately west of him in the line.

- The man at the extreme western end didnâ€™t understand what to do, so he threw his paper away; the remaining 2,999,999 slips of paper were put into a huge basket and taken to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

- Write a solution to the problem to re-construct the original order

## To Run

Start with `npm i` to install all dependencies

`npm start` will run the code.
